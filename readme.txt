= HELP! It doesnt work?! =

There is a small, small chance this plugin may not work on your web host. This is caused by two things generally: a mod_security rule flagging the ZIP upload, or the lack of PHP libraries needed to unzip files. Here's the good news: your host can fix both of these easily. If they refuse, consider moving to a more modern host.
